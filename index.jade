          I am currently a [Computer Science Engineering](http://cse.eecs.umich.edu) undergraduate 
          student in my final semester at the University of Michigan. I'm involved in research centering
          around computer security and internet measurement. In June of 2018 I 
          will begin working full-time at [Duo Security](http://duo.sc).

          Specifically, I am working towards a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science Engineering with a
          [Music Minor](http://www.music.lsa.umich.edu). As part of undergraduate research I maintain
          [ZGrab](https://github.com/zmap/zgrab), and the [Censys
          Search Engine](https://www.censys.io). I also wrote [ZGrab2](https://github.com/zmap/zgrab2), 
          a framework for application-layer scanning.
          Since January of 2017 I've been an instructional aide for the undergraduate
          computer security course at Michigan, [EECS 388](https://eecs388.org).
          I have also been a peer mentor in a learning community and a manager in the 
          dining hall where I developed and deployed an attendance monitoring software system.

          Winter Percussion](https://legendspaa.org), [Genesis Winter Percussion](https://genesis-percussion.org), [University of Michigan
          University Band](https://smtd.umich.edu/current_students/perf_opps/bands.htm) and have participated in various performances/recitals.

          I grew up in Grand Rapids, Michigan where I attended Kenowa Hills High School. 
          You could have found me more often than not playing music in the band room.
          In my spare time I enjoy reading and kayaking on the Huron river.
